# Binary-Classification
Classifying salaries of individual's based on various factors 

Problem Statement : 

WHO is a specialized agency of the UN which is concerned with the world population health. Based upon the various parameters, WHO allocates budget for various areas to conduct various campaigns/initiatives to improve healthcare. Annual salary is an important variable which is considered to decide budget to be allocated for an area.

We have a data which contains information about 32561 samples and 15 continuous and categorical variables. Extraction of data was done from 1994 Census dataset.

The goal here is to build a binary model to predict whether the salary is >50K or <50K.
